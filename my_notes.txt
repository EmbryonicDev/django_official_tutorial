** Database setup for SQLite
    mysite/settings:
        * Update TIME_ZONE -> 'CET'
        * Create tables in database before they can be used:
            - comment out or delete unnecessary apps from INSTALLED_APPS before migrating
            - To migrate:
                $ python3 manage.py migrate

** Creating models
    - add Question / Choice models to polls/models.py

** Activating models
    - Add to mysite/settings.py / INSTALLED_APPS:
        "polls.apps.PollsConfig",
    - migrate models to database:
        $ python3 manage.py makemigrations polls

    *** Optional ***
    - Run command that takes migration names and prints their SQL:
        $ python3 manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
    - Run command to check for problems in project: 
        $ python3 manage.py check

    - Run migrate again to create model tables in database:
        $ python3 manage.py migrate

    ** Change your models (in models.py).
    ** Run < python manage.py makemigrations ..app_name.. > to create migrations for those changes
    ** Run < python3 manage.py migrate > to apply those changes to the database
